# By default, there is a running worker when you start the Rails server. That is
# convenient in development, but may be (or not) a problem in deployment.
#
# Please keep in mind that there should always be a running worker or schedules
# may get triggered to late. Some deployments (like Passenger) won't guarantee
# the Rails server process is running all the time, so that there's no always-on
# worker. Also beware that the Ruote::HashStorage only supports one worker.
#
# If you don't want to start a worker thread within your Rails server process,
# replace the line before this comment with the following:
#
# RuoteKit.engine = Ruote::Engine.new(RUOTE_STORAGE)
#
# To run a worker in its own process, there's a rake task available:
#
#     rake ruote:run_worker
#
# Stop the task by pressing Ctrl+C

unless $RAKE_TASK
  # don't register participants when the run is triggered by a rake task

  # RuoteKit.dashboard.register do
  # 
  #   # register your own participants using the participant method
  #   #
  #   # Example: participant 'alice', Ruote::StorageParticipant see
  #   # http://ruote.rubyforge.org/participants.html for more info
  # 
  #   # register the catchall storage participant named '.+'
  #   catchall
  # end
end

# when true, the engine will be very noisy (stdout)
#
# RuoteKit.dashboard.noisy = true

# require Rails.root.join('app/models/workitem.rb')
